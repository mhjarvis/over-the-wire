The ```cat``` command will concatenate files and print on the standard output. The ```ls``` command will list directory contents. ```man ls``` will provide access to the manpage where there are several important OPTIONS available. While not needed here, the following OPTIONS are important to know when using the ```ls``` command:

    -a, --all           //does not ignore entries with .
    -l                  //use a long listing format
    -al                 //combine both OPTIONS

Solution: 

    cat readme

### Bandit Level 1 => Level 2
Username: bandit1</br>
Password: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

The ```pwd``` command prints the location of the current directory. Attempting to use ```cat -``` will not do much since the '-' character is a special character for providing argumets. The prefix ```./``` should solve the problem as it clarify that the file is in the current directory.

Solution:

    cat ./-

### Bandit Level 2 => Level 3
Username: bandit2</br>
Password: CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

The command ```cat``` alone will not work, as each blank space creates a new argument. Using quotations or escaping the spaces will reference the words as one file name.

Solution:

    cat "spaces in this filename"

### Bandit Level 3 => 4
Username: bandit3</br>
Password: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

Solution:

    cat inhere/.hidden

### Bandit Level 4 => 5
Username: bandit4</br>
Password: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

The ```file``` command helps determine file type. Using grep and piping can help filter out only those 'human-readable' files (ASCII). 

Solution:

    cd inhere
    file ./* | grep ASCII
    cat ./-file07

### Bandit Level 5 => 6
Username: bandit5</br>

The ```find``` command will search fo rfiles in a dierctory hierarchy. The following OPTIONS will be helpful: 

    -executable         //matches files which are executable
    -size n             //files uses 'n' units of space, rounding up
    -type c             //file is of type 'c'

The '!' exclamation point also means 'not'. 

Solution:

    find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
    cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2

### Bandit Level 6 => 7
Username: bandit6</br>
Password: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7

The following OPTIONS will be helpful with the ```find ``` command:

    -group gname            //file belongs to group gname (numeric group ID allowed)
    -user uname             //file is owned by user uname (numberic user ID allowed)
    -size n                 //file uses 'n' units of space, rounding up

The following is used to help filter out information ```2>/dev/null``` does.

    > file                  //redirects stdout to file
    1> file                 //redirects stdout to file
    2> file                 //redirects stderr to file

Solution:

    cd /                    //go to root directory
    find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
    cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
